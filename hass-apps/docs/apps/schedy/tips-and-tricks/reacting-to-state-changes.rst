Reacting to Changes of Schedy's State
=====================================

Each room records its state to an entity in Home Assistant. This entity
is named ``schedy_room.<app name>_<room name>``.

The state of such an entity is the value currently set for the
room. Since values can be changed manually, this is not necessarily the
one generated by the schedule. The actual scheduled value is stored as
the ``scheduled_value`` attribute of the entity.

You can use normal Home Assistant automations to react to changes of
these entities.
