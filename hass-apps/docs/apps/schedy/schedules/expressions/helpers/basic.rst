Basic Helpers
=============

``app``
-------

``app: SchedyApp``

There is an object available under the name ``app`` which represents
the ``appdaemon.plugins.hass.hassapi.Hass`` object of Schedy. You could,
for instance, retrieve values of input sliders via the normal AppDaemon
API.


``room_name``
-------------

``room_name: str``

A string representing the name of the room the expression is evaluated
for as set in Schedy's configuration (not the friendly name).


``schedule_snippets``
---------------------

``schedule_snippets: Dict[str, Schedule]``

A dictionary containing all configured schedule snippets, indexed by
their name for use with ``IncludeSchedule()``.


``is_empty``
------------

``is_empty(iterable: Iterable) -> bool``

Returns whether the given iterable is empty.

next() is used for testing the iterable. For iterators, this has the
side effect of the first item being consumed, but it avoids generating
all values just for decision about emptiness.


``round_to_step``
-----------------

``round_to_step(value: Union[float, int], step: Union[float, int], decimal_places: int = None) -> Union[float, int]``

Round the value to the nearest step and, optionally, the given number
of decimal places.

Examples:

::

    round_to_step(34, 25) == 25
    round_to_step(0.665, 0.2, 1) == 0.6
