# This hook should perform all actions required for moving the actor
# to the state corresponding to the value given as "value". The result
# of the hook isn't respected. You'll probably use this for calling
# some services.
#send_hook: <required>

# This hook is executed when a state update is received from the
# watched entity. It has the dictionary with all received state attributes
# available in the variable "state". The result has to be the scheduling
# value corresponding to this state. If the result is None, the state
# change is ignored.
# When you don't define a state hook, the actor doesn't react to state
# changes at all. Inferring values from states is then impossible, which
# also disables change replication between actors in a room. Should you
# really decide to not map states back to values, make sure you set the
# "send_retries" setting to a low value, because the actor won't be able
# to notice when it has reached the desired state and always send until
# the configured number of retries is exceeded.
#state_hook: ...

# This hook is optional and may be used to preprocess a value generated
# by scheduling before it is stored and passed on to the send hook. The
# value is available under the name "value". The result of this hook
# has to be the updated value or None, in which case the value change
# is discarded and no send hook is executed.
#filter_value_hook: ...

# The config parameter is a dictionary which is available in all hooks
# under the name "config". It can be filled with anything you like and
# hence is useful for reusing a custom actor template, each time with
# different settings. You may want to store things like attribute names
# to be used by your custom hooks in the config dictionary.
# It's empty by default.
